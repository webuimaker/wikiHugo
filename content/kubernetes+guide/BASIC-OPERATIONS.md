## Installing Kubernetes

Installation can sometimes be a challenge. Learn how to install Kubernetes on Ubuntu, Windows, CentOS and other platforms.

**See our compilation of** {{< read-more "Kubernetes Installation Resources" "/display/containers/Installing+Kubernetes"  >}}

## Configuration

Kubernetes reads YAML files to configure services, pods and replication controllers. Learn how to use Kubernetes configuration to deploy containers at scale.

**See our compilation of** {{< read-more "Kubernetes Configuration Resources" "/display/containers/Kubernetes+Configuration"  >}}

## Monitoring

At any scale, monitoring Kubernetes as well as the health of application deployment and the underlying containers is essential to ensure good performance. Monitoring Kubernetes requires rethinking existing monitoring strategies, especially if you are using traditional hosts such as VMs or physical machines.

**See our compilation of resources about** {{< read-more "monitoring Kubernetes clusters with tools like Prometheus and Datadog" "/display/containers/Kubernetes+Monitoring"  >}}

## Debugging and Troubleshooting

Because of the massively distributed nature of Kubernetes, debugging can be complex. Learn how to troubleshoot problems that arise when creating and managing Kubernetes pods, replication controllers, services, and containers.

## Load Balancing

Load balancing is a straightforward task in many non-container environments, but it involves a bit of special handling when it comes to containers. There are two types of load balancing in Kubernetes - Internal load balancing across containers of the same type using a label, and external load balancing.

**See our compilation of resources about** {{< read-more "configuring and using the Kubernetes load balancer feature" "/display/containers/Kubernetes+Load+Balancing"  >}}

## Kubernetes Security

Kubernetes provides many controls that can improve application security. Configuring them requires intimate knowledge of Kubernetes and the specific deploymentâ€™s security requirements. Learn more about best practices for deployment, sharing data and network security in Kuberetes.

**See our compilation of resources about** {{< read-more "Kubernetes Security" "/display/containers/kubernetes+security"  >}}

## Kubernetes Storage Management


Storage is a critical part of running stateful containers, and Kubernetes offers powerful primitives for managing it. Learn how to work with Kubernetes storage options and provision storage in Kubernetes.
