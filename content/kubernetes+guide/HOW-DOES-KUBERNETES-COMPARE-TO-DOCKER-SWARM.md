[Docker vs. Kubernetes](/display/containers/Docker+vs.+Kubernetes+-+8+Industry+Opinions) - which should you use for container orchestration? Docker Swarm is considered the "lightweight" [alternative to Kubernetes](/display/containers/Kubernetes+Alternatives). Docker swarm mode allows you to manage a cluster of Docker Engines, natively within the Docker platform. You can use the Docker CLI to create a swarm, deploy application services to a swarm, and manage swarm behavior.  


Swarm's capabilities include coordination between containers, allocating tasks to groups of containers, health checks and lifecycle management of containers, redundancy and failover, scaling containers up and down based on load, and rolling updates.
