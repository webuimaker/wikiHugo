- **[Installing Kubernetes](/display/containers/installing+kubernetes)**  —There are many ways to install Kubernetes Guide and the obvious starting point is the&nbsp;setup&nbsp;section, but the installation process can sometimes be a challenge. This page gathers resources about how to install Kubernetes on various environments like Ubuntu, Windows and CentOS.

- **[Kubernetes Configuration](/display/containers/kubernetes+configuration)**  — Kubernetes Guide reads&nbsp;YAML&nbsp;files to configure services, pods and replication controllers.This page gathers resources about working with the Kubernetes configuration to deploy containers.

- **[Kubernetes Monitoring](/display/containers/kubernetes+monitoring)**  — Monitoring Kubernetes effectively requires to rethink and reorient all monitoring strategies, especially if using traditional hosts such as VMs or physical machines. This page gathers resources about how to monitor Kubernetes cluster with tools like Prometheus and Datadog.

- **[Kubernetes Debugging and Troubleshooting ](/display/containers/kubernetes+debugging+and+troubleshooting)**  — Resources about the process of managing and maintaining production-grade, highly available Kubernetes clusters, including Kubernetes security, Kubernetes networking, Kubernetes load balancing and more.

- **[Kubernetes Load Balancing](/display/containers/kubernetes+load+balancing )**  — Load balancing is a relatively straightforward task in many non-container environments, but it involves a bit of special handling when it comes to containers. There are two different types of load balancing in Kubernetes - Internal load balancing across containers of the same type using a label, and external load balancing. This page gathers resources about how to configure and use the Kubernetes load balancer feature.

- **[Kubernetes Security](https://www.aquasec.com/solutions/kubernetes-container-security/)**  — Kubernetes Guide provides many controls that can improve application security. Configuring them requires intimate knowledge with Kubernetes and the deployment’s security requirements.&nbsp;This page gathers resources about security best practices for Kubernetes, including best practices for deployment, sharing data and network security.

- **[Kubernetes Networking](/display/containers/kubernetes+networking+101)**  — Kubernetes does not provide any default network implementation, rather it only defines the model and leaves to other tools to implement it. There are many implementations nowadays like Flannel,&nbsp;Calico&nbsp;and&nbsp;Weave. This page gathers resources about how to set up highly available networked Kubernetes clusters.

- **[Kubernetes Storage Management](/display/containers/kubernetes+storage+management)**  —  Kubernetes is complex, and difficult to set up and configure. The best approach, therefore, is to seek out a complete container solution that includes Kubernetes as a supported, maintained component. This page gathers resources about the leading Kubetnetes distributions such as OpenShift, Canonical, Rancher and more.

- **[Kubernetes in Production](/display/containers/kubernetes+in+production)**  —  The default configurations for Kubernetes Guide components are not designed for heavy and dynamic production workloads, characteristic of DevOps environments and micro-services based application deployments where containers are quickly created and destroyed.&nbsp;This page gathers resources about how to create a production-ready Kubernetes cluster, including examples and tutorials.

- **[Working with Kubernetes Ingress](/display/containers/working+with+kubernetes+ingress)**  —  Kubernetes ingress is a collection of routing rules that govern how external users access services running in a Kubernetes cluster. &nbsp;This page will introduce general strategies in Kubernetes for ingress, tutorials on how to build and troubleshoot Kubernetes Ingress controller and more.
