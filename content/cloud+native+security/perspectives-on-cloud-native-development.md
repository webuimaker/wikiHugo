 - title: "451 Report - Security for Cloud-Native Compute Will Be Different"
   summary: "With increased adoption comes increased scrutiny. We should expect more attention on container- and serverless-specific security concerns, including software image integrity, secrets management, controlled access to orchestration management, and several considerations around runtime protection and monitoring. This 451 Business Impact Report explains the requirements of cloud native security and why organizations should approach it differently."

 - title: "An Essential Guide to Cloud Native Security"
   summary: "Cloud native applications are typically built using a microservices or container-based approach running on Linux. These applications are designed to be lightweight, flexible and focused on single tasks. Being cloud-native leads to a radically different approach to application development, deployment, and to infrastructure management. The same is true for security — a reimagining of security must take place for cloud-native applications, or we risk cannibalizing the benefits of cloud computing. Learn how to handle these security challenges"
