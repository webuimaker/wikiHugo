 - title: "Streamline Image Vulnerability Management for OpenShift Image Streams"
   summary: "Red Hat Openshift Container Platform (OCP) allows users to build environments that work more efficiently for large and diversified setups, by using Image Streams instead of regular images when building and deploying applications. From a security perspective, this requires a different approach for tracking security issues that should work natively with OpenShift Red Hat. "
