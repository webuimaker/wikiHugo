Logs give you the real picture of whatâ€™s happening with your containerized applications and infrastructure. They are vital for managing containers in production.

## The Elastic Stack

The Elastic stack is primarily powered by [Elasticsearch](/display/containers/Using+Docker+with+ElasticSearch), the full-text database engine that can query large quantities of unstructured data in real-time. It is bolstered by Kibana, an open source visualization tool. Together, they bring deep visibility into container logs without breaking the bank.

## Sumo Logic

A logging service provider, Sumo Logic takes the pain out of log analysis with easy setup and a maintenance-free logging service. It can capture logs from Kubernetes or any other container tool via API integration.

The list of tools is not exhaustive, but these are the cream of the crop and are vital to running container workloads in production. What stands out from this list is that the tooling around Docker has really matured, and containers are all set to hit the mainstream in every organization.
