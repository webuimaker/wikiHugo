title: "Kubernetes Load Balancing"
description: "Load balancing is a relatively straightforward task in many non-container environments, but it involves a bit of special handling when it comes to containers. There are two different types of load balancing in Kubernetes - Internal load balancing across containers of the same type using a label, and external load balancing. This page gathers resources about how to configure and use the Kubernetes load balancer feature."
