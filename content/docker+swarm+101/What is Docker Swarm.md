[Docker](/display/containers/docker+containers) swarm mode allows you to manage a cluster of Docker Engines, natively within the Docker platform. You can use the Docker CLI to create a swarm, deploy application services to a swarm, and manage swarm behavior.

Docker will shortly support [Kubernetes Guide](/display/containers/kubernetes+guide) as well as Docker Swarm, and Docker users will be able to use either Kubernetes or Swarm to orchestrate their container workloads.


Swarm can help developers and IT administrators:

* Coordinate between containers and allocate tasks to groups of containers


* Perform health checks and manage lifecycle of individual containers

* Provide redundancy and failover in case nodes experience failure

* Scale the number of containers up and down depending on load 

* Perform rolling updates of software across multiple containers
