As of the time of this writing in late 2017, Docker has announced it will support  both Swarm and Kubernetes  as orchestration engines. Analysts have  raised questions  about the future of Swarm in light of this decision. 

Some believe that with support for Kubernetes, Docker Swarm, which is less robust and has a smaller feature set, will become obsolete. Others say that Swarm will continue to be relevant, as a simpler orchestration tool which is suitable for organizations with smaller container workloads.
