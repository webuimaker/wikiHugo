Docker Swarm is an orchestration tool provided as part of the Docker platform. It is an alternative to other popular container orchestration tools, such as Kubernetes and Apache Mesos. Swarm is considered easy to use, especially for those already familiar with the Docker model, and should be an easy first step into the world of managing multiple containers and composing them into services and applications.
