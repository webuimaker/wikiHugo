 - title: "Container Image Immutability and the Power of Metadata"
   summary: "One of the principles of Docker containers is that an image is immutable — once built, it’s unchangeable, and if you want to make changes, you’ll get a new image as a result. In this post, we’ll take a deep dive into the immutability of containers, and then we’ll look at some of the consequences and potential problems, as well as see how applying some metadata to your container images can really help."

   summary: "Docker containers are in fact immutable. This means that a running container never changes because in case you need to update it, the best practice is to create a new container with the updated version of your application and delete the old one."
