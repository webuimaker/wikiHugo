# Forbes: Docker and Kubernetes, Friends or Foes?

<small>

**Date:**

April 28, 2017


**Opinion by:**

Mike Kavis, VP/Principal Architect for Cloud Technology Partners

## The gist:

While industry commentators talk about a battle between Docker and Kubernetes, in reality Docker is a wider platform and not just about containers. The orchestration tier is only one part of Docker's offering, and there is still a very big need for the platform, even if the orchestration layer were replaced with Kubernetes.

---

## Bottom line:
Kubernetes is an enabler for Docker, not a competitor. Docker's main interest is to have more Docker engines running, which will increase their support revenues. Support for Kubernetes and greater uptake of Kubernetes should only help with this goal.

## The gist:

Both Docker and Mesos realized that mindshare behind Kubernetes is just too big and made a pragmatic decision to support Kubernetes, while not giving up on their native solutions, Swarm and Marathon.

---


## Bottom line:
Docker Swarm and Mesos/Marathon are good solutions, but analysts believe Kubernetes will eventually take over, and there is no room in the market for three orchestration platforms.
