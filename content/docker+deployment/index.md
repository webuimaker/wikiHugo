Itâ€™s very easy and quick to get started with [Docker](/display/containers/Docker+vs.+Vagrant) on your laptop. It takes a few minutes to download a container image and spin up a new container from it locally. What starts out so simple gets complicated as you scale to hundreds of containers, and want to deploy these containers into production. All of a sudden you need to think of how to execute all the tasks related to container management, how to transition to a microservices architecture, and how to secure containers in production.
