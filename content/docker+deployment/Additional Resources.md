* <strong>What is a microservices architecture?</strong>

Martin Fowler [explains](https://martinfowler.com/articles/microservices.html) what’s new about microservices and why you should transition to it from a legacy application.

* <strong>How is a service mesh different from an API?</strong>

It’s easy to confuse the two, but this is a useful read to understand how APIs perform a similar yet different function from a service mesh.

* <strong>How is [Linkerd](/display/containers/linkerd+vs+istio) different from Istio?</strong>

They both enable the modern container service mesh, and they work together well, but they are different from each other.
