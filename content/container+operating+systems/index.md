title: "Container Operating Systems"
description: "Since containers package so many of the libraries and subsystems that once were part of the operating system into the container, there’s increasingly less need for traditional server operating systems. In their place have sprung up a bevy of lightweight operating systems that significantly reduce the footprint of the operating system. This page gathers resources about lightweight container operating systems such as CoreOS, Rancher OS, Atomic and more."
