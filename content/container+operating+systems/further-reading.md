- **[Containers and Cloud Computing](/display/containers/Containers+and+Cloud+Computing)**—  Containers changed the adoption of public and private clouds. With a container image, a common package format can be run on premises as well as on every major cloud provider. This page gathers resources about how containers changed the world of cloud computing and how to run them in the cloud.
- **[Container Operating Systems](/display/containers/Container+Operating+Systems)**—  Since containers package so many of the libraries and subsystems that once were part of the operating system into the container, there’s increasingly less need for traditional server operating systems. In their place have sprung up a bevy of lightweight operating systems that significantly reduce the footprint of the operating system. This page gathers resources about lightweight container operating systems such as CoreOS, Rancher OS, Atomic and more.
- **[Red Hat Openshift](/display/containers/Red+Hat+Openshift)**—  Red Hat OpenShift is an open source container application platform by Red Hat based on top of Docker containers and the Kubernetes container cluster manager for enterprise app development and deployment. This page gathers resources about the benefits of OpenShift, different types of deployments in AWS and Azure and more.
- **[Pivotal Container Service](/display/containers/Pivotal+Container+Service)**—  Pivotal Container Service (PKS) is an enterprise Kubernetes platform, architected for rapid results, scaling, and reliability on any infrastructure. It&nbsp;enables operators to provision, operate, and manage enterprise-grade Kubernetes clusters using BOSH and Pivotal Ops Manager. This page gather&nbsp;resources about&nbsp;Pivotal Container Service and how to use it.
- **[Multi-Cloud Strategy](/display/containers/Multi-Cloud+Strategy)**—  Multi-cloud is the use of multiple cloud computing and storage services in a single heterogeneous architecture. This page gathers resources about the benefits, challenges and best practices of multi-cloud adoption.
  
- **[Kubernetes vs Cloud Foundry](/display/containers/Kubernetes+vs+Cloud+Foundry)**—  Pivotal’s Cloud Foundry (PCF) and Kubernetes (K8s) are both platform services for deploying cloud-native apps. There’s a lot of functional overlap between PCF and K8s, but it’s important to understand how they differ from each other and when it’s best to use one rather than the other, and when it’s best to use them together.
- **[CWPP](/display/containers/CWPP)**—   A cloud workload is a discrete capability or amount of work you’d like to run on a&nbsp;c https://www.aquasec.com/wiki/display/containers/Cloud+Native+Securityloud instance.&nbsp;Cloud Workload Protection Platforms (CWPP)&nbsp;is defined by host-centric solutions that target the unique requirements of server workload protection in modern hybrid data center architectures.&nbsp;This page gathers resources about&nbsp;Cloud Workload Protection Platforms.
