Docker plugins are out-of-process extensions which add capabilities to the Docker Engine. The Docker engine network plugins API allows for support of a wide range of networking technologies to be realized. Once a networking plugin has been developed and installed, they behave just like the built-in bridge, overlay and macvlan network drivers.
