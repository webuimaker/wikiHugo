title: "Refactoring a Monolith to Microservices"
description: "Today’s requirements on modern web applications demand high availability and scalability for which a microservice architecture has shown to be a promising solution. However, building a microservice architecture from scratch is sometimes not possible when monolithic web applications are already in place and cannot be replaced. Instead, it is required to break up this monolith step-by-step into microservices."
