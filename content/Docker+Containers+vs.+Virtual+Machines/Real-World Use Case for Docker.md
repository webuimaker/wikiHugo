Paypal uses Docker to drive “cost efficiency and enterprise-grade security” for its infrastructure. Paypal runs VMs and containers side-by-side and says that containers reduce the number of VMs it needs to run.

* <strong>Application development:</strong> Docker is primarily used to package an application’s code and its dependencies. The same container can be shared from Dev to QA and later to IT, thus bringing portability to the development pipeline.

* <strong>Running microservices applications: </strong>Docker lets you run each microservice that makes up an application in its own container. In this way, it enables a distributed architecture.
