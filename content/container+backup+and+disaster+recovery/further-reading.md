Since containers run on a shared host and typically use multiple components to deliver a complete solution, there are many considerations that are required to secure container environment. This page gathers resources about managing security in containers including security considerations, security best practices and more.

- **[Container Deployment](/display/containers/container+deployment)** — Container-based deployments have become the preferred approach for managing the build and release of complex applications. Popular container technologies such as Docker enable developer velocity by providing a robust environment closely resembling production that can be constructed in minutes. This page gathers resources about container-based deployments, including overviews, tutorials and more.

- **[Container Monitoring](/display/containers/container+monitoring)** — Container monitoring is the activity of monitoring the performance of microservice containers in different environments. Monitoring is the first step towards optimizing and improving performance. This page gathers resources about the container monitoring process, tools and important metrics to watch during the process.

- **[Container Automation](/display/containers/container+automation)** — Software development groups realize that the only way they can make the development and tooling processes work at scale is by automating as much as possible to reduce the scope of manual process. This page gathers resources about how containers integrate in different aspects of automation like automated builds, automated tests and more.
- **[Container Multitenancy](/display/containers/container+multitenancy)** — Multi-tenancy is an architecture in which a single instance of a software application serves multiple customers. Each customer is called a tenant. This page gathers resources about the importance of multitenancy in containerize apps delivery.

- **[Container Backup and Disaster Recovery](/display/containers/container+backup+and+disaster+recovery)** — Containers are like any other data source that needs to be protected. As your organization comes to rely on Docker containerization technology for critical IT functions, you need to ensure appropriate safeguards are in place to minimize disruptions to your business operations. This page gathers resources about container backup and disaster recovery methods, tools and guides on how to set it up.


- **[Prometheus Monitoring](/display/containers/prometheus+monitoring)**— Prometheus is a systems and service monitoring system. It collects metrics from configured targets at given intervals, evaluates rule expressions, displays the results, and can trigger alerts if some condition is observed to be true. This Page gathers resources about Prometheus’ architecture, pros and cons, Installing Prometheus and more.
