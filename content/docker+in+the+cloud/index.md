Though Docker containers can be run on private cloud infrastructure, many users naturally want to run them in public cloud platforms. This brings you the benefits of the cloud-like scale, economy, and simplicity. It also avoids the hassle of having to manage the lower layers of your infrastructure and frees you to focus on what really matters - your apps and services.
