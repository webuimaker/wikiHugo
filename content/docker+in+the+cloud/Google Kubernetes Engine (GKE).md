[GKE](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/) delivers the most upstream version of Kubernetes and focuses on automating much of the Kubernetes management tasks.

Like its competitors, GKE integrates into other Google Cloud services for access management, security and more. It also provides unique features like preemptible virtual machines that are low-cost instances with a short lifespan suitable for running batch jobs.

> There are many factors to consider, and many options available to run Docker in the cloud. Whether you run Docker on-premise or in the cloud, and whether you choose a big public cloud vendor like AWS, there are numerous capable solutions available. The different container services are taking different routes to building the perfect place to run your containers in the cloud. The key differentiators are level of automation, ease of use, and depth of integration with other tools. Be sure to pick the one that’s right for your organization based on where you are at today, and how you expect to evolve in the future.
