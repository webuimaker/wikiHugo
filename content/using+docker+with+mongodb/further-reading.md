This page gathers resources about how to load balance dockerized applications and how to use NGINX as a reverse proxy to Docker applications.
- **[Using Docker With Jenkins](/display/containers/using+docker+with+jenkins)**  — Jenkins is one of the most popular, if not the most popular, continuous integration and continuous deployment tool available. This process could become even more efficient using Docker and containers. This page gathers resources on why Docker is a good option when it comes to continuous deployment with Jenkins.
- **[Using Docker With ElasticSearch](/display/containers/using+docker+with+elasticSearch)**  — Elasticsearch is a powerful open source search and analytics engine that makes data easy to explore. This page gathers resources about how to use Docker with ElasticSearch, Kibana and Logstash  for monitoring, log analysis and how to deploy elasticsearch docker containers.
- **[Using Docker with MongoDB ](/display/containers/using+docker+with+mongoDB")**  — MongoDB is a free and open-source cross-platform document-oriented database program. This page gathers resources about the challenges in running and orchestrating MongoDB in Docker containers, &nbsp;running MongoDB as a replica set in Docker and more.
- **[Using Docker with PosgreSQL](/display/containers/using+docker+with+posgreSQL)**  — Postgres, is an object-relational database management system with an emphasis on extensibility and standards compliance. This page gathers resources on some basic performance metrics for PostgreSQL when they are run as containers.
- **[Using Docker with Python](/display/containers/Using+docker+with+python)**  — Python packaging is awkward and confusing. Docker is a collection of various Linux features - namespaces, cgroups, union file-system - put together in such a way that you can package and distribute software in a language-agnostic container. Docker is a great way to skirt the pain of Python packaging.
- **[Docker vs. Vagrant](/display/containers/docker+vs.+vagrant)**  — Vagrant is a tool focused on providing a consistent development environment workflow across multiple operation systems. Docker is a container management that can consistently run software as long as a containerization system exists. This page compares their features, pros and cons to see which is better and if they can work together.
