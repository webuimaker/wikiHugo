- **[Kubernetes 101](/display/containers/Kubernetes+101)**  —If you're getting started with K8s, or want to go in depth, we have you covered with comprehensive reviews of the most important topics for those deploying and using Kubernetes.
- **[Kubernetes Architecture](/display/containers/Kubernetes+Architecture)**  — The Kubernetes cluster architecture provides a flexible, loosely-coupled mechanism for service discovery. Like most distributed computing platforms, a Kubernetes cluster consists of at least one master and multiple compute nodes. This page gathers resources about the Kubernetes architecture components like Kubernetes Nodes, Kubernetes Pods, Kubernetes Registry and more.
- **[Kubernetes Advantages and Use Cases](/display/containers/Kubernetes+Advantages+and+Use+Cases)**  — Kubernetes Guide is a system developed by Google, for managing containerized applications in a clustered environment. It aims to provide better ways of managing related, distributed components across varied infrastructure. This page gathers resources about the advantages and common use cases of using Kubernetes.
- **[Kubernetes Operations ](/display/containers/Kubernetes+perations)**  — Resources about the process of managing and maintaining production-grade, highly available Kubernetes clusters, including Kubernetes security, Kubernetes networking, Kubernetes load balancing and more.
- **[Kubernetes Cluster ](/display/containers/Kubernetes+Cluster )**  — A Kubernetes Guide cluster is made of a master node and a set of worker nodes. In a production environment these run in a distributed setup on multiple nodes. Kubernetes has six main components that form a functioning cluster: API server, Scheduler, Controller manager, kubelet, kube-proxy, etcd. •This page gathers resources about Kubernetes cluster procedures such as configuration, resource management and monitoring.
- **[Kubernetes as a Service](/display/containers/Kubernetes+as+a+Service)**  — Kubernetes as a Service is the method how your team should organize, or service, pods and the policy by which your team accesses them. Often called a microservice, this organization depends on a variety of unique variables. This Page gathers resources about managed Kubernetes platforms like Amazon EKS, Azure container service and GKE.
- **[Managed Kubernetes](/display/containers/Managed+Kubernetes)**  — Managed Kubernetes service provide a simple command for creating an entire Kubernetes cluster. This includes the provisioning of machines, installation of Kubernetes, and forming of a cluster. All this is done automatically behind the scenes. All the major cloud providers, AWS, Google, Azure, and IBM Cloud, currently provide managed Kubernetes services. This page gathers a detailed comparison of Managed Kubernetes platforms.
- **[Kubernetes Distributions](/display/containers/Kubernetes+Distributions)**  —  Kubernetes is complex, and difficult to set up and configure. The best approach, therefore, is to seek out a complete container solution that includes Kubernetes as a supported, maintained component. This page gathers resources about the leading Kubetnetes distributions such as OpenShift, Canonical, Rancher and more.
- **[Enterprise Kubernetes](/display/containers/Enterprise+Kubernetess)**  —  When Kubernetes came on the scene in 2014, it made an impact and continues to impact the way companies build software. Large companies have backed it, causing a ripple effect in the industry and impacting open source and commercial systems. This page gather resources about Kubernetes in the enterprise : features, considerations, and case studies.
