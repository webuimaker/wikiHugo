- **[Containers and Hybrid Clouds](/display/containers/containers+and+hybrid+clouds)** — The growing number of hybrid cloud deployments is accelerating the demand for enterprise container infrastructure as companies seek a consistent application development environment. This page gathers resources about the combination of containers and hybrid clouds including benefits of this combination and tutorials on how to get started.

- **[Containers and Private Clouds](/display/containers/containers+and+private+clouds)** — Private cloud&nbsp;is a type of&nbsp;cloud&nbsp;computing that delivers similar advantages to public&nbsp;cloud, including scalability and self-service, but through a proprietary architecture. This page gathers resources about the combination of containers and private clouds and how they can serve as a container management environment.

- **[Containers in The Data Center](/display/containers/containers+in+the+data+center)** — Containers are being adopted in the data center in a rapid pace. Infrastructure managers must embrace this change to address the demands of bimodal IT, but in a controlled and tactical manner. This page gathers resources about&nbsp;the role of containers in data centers and the implications that container adoption will have for data center operators.

- **[Containers and Virtualization](/display/containers/containers+and+virtualization)** — As virtualization continues to increase in importance, containers will increasingly take center stage. This page gathers resources about&nbsp;running containers on virtual machines.

- **[Containers and Serverless Computing](/display/containers/containers+and+serverless+computing)** — Serverless computing&nbsp;is a cloud&nbsp;computing execution model in which the cloud provider dynamically manages the allocation of machine resources.&nbsp;This page gathers resources about containers and serverless computing, the benefits and disadvantages of each one and their impact on application deployment.


- **[Containers and Hyperconvergence](/display/containers/containers+and+hyperconvergence)** — Hyperconvergence is an IT framework that combines storage, computing and networking into a single system in an effort to reduce data center complexity and increase scalability. This page gathers resources about how the combination of containers and hyperconvergence can help IT to achieve greater efficiency at all layers.


- **[Containers and Big Data](/display/containers/containers+and+big+data)** — Until a short while ago, data analysts concentrated on algorithms, and containers were merely there to help. However in the era of Big Data, the choice of data containers is critical. This page gathers resources about how can containers contribute to improving Big Data.
