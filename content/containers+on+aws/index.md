title: "Containers on AWS"
description: "This page gathers resources about how to choose a container environment on AWS. AWS offers two fully managed control planes to choose between: Amazon ECS and Amazon EKS. In order to run containers on AWS you need an underlying pool of resources that the control plane can use to launch your containers. There are two options for doing this: Amazon ECS Container Instances or AWS Fargate, which is a service for running containers without needing to manage the underlying infrastructure."
