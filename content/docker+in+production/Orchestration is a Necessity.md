Kubernetes is the leading container orchestrator today and is all set to grow in adoption, bringing more consistency to the Docker ecosystem. Kubernetes removes the nitty-gritty of managing individual container instances and underlying infrastructure. It abstracts away the low-level details and lets you manage services instead.

With powerful features like Federation, Kubernetes is built to let you manage multiple clusters of containers. These clusters can be located in a single cloud platform, or across multiple platforms. What Kubernetes’ Federation feature brings is a uniform way to sync resources across the clusters and automatically configures load balancing and service discovery across these clusters.

[Scheduling](http://blog.kubernetes.io/2017/03/advanced-scheduling-in-kubernetes.html) is simply the process of placing pods on nodes within your Kubernetes cluster. The advanced scheduling features of Kubernetes gives you various options on how you’d like to place pods on nodes. You could have them spread out evenly on nodes based on available resources, or have certain pods located on nodes with a specific type of resources, or something in-between.

With these and many more unique features, Kubernetes is becoming indispensable to running Docker in production.
