A [Docker](/display/containers/Docker+Containers)  image is a template from which new [Docker containers](/display/containers/Running+Docker+Containers) can be started. A [Dockerfile](/display/containers/Working+With+Dockerfiles) is a short file that contains instructions for the new Docker containers that are created from the image. In this page we explained basic concepts of Docker images, the idea of Image Registries which allow you to publish images for use by others and consume images published by others, common operations such as building a new image, listing all images and publishing a local image to a registry, some important best practices for working with images, and how to create and remove a base image.
