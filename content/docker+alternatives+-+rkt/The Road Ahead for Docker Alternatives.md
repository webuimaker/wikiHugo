As the various Docker alternatives mentioned move ahead with rooting out bugs, increasing security, extending functionality, and adding new features, we will also have service providers offering hosting options, even more, agile development options, distributed applications, and microservices.

One of the directions that these platforms would be heading towards is better support, tools, and strategies for containerizing legacy applications. We also have a consortium of companies like the [Cloud Native Computing Foundation](https://www.cncf.io/) that is driving innovation across such projects as well as incubating new projects centered around these platforms and services. Among the various [container runtimes](/display/containers/container+runtime+interface) discussed above, rkt and [containerd](/display/containers/Containerd) have been accepted as [ongoing projects](https://www.cncf.io/projects/) by the [Cloud Native Computing Foundation](/display/containers/cloud+Native+computing+foundation).

As you can see, there may be many container runtimes available. This is a good thing, as it promotes innovation and gives developers a range of tools to suit their specific needs, while still having consolidation around Docker itself. Hopefully, this article has you thinking about what container format you would use for your next application.
