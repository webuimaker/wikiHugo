 - title: "A Short Guide to Using Docker for your Data Science Environment"
   summary: "The ability to build upon other’s systems is one of the biggest advantages while using docker. You can get started with simply cloning an already existing environment if it satisfies all your needs, or, you can build on top of it to make it even more useful for your specific use case using your dockerfile. This article we’ll go through Docker as a container service and steps needed to get started with building your custom development platform for data science."
