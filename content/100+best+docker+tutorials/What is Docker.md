Docker is an open source tool that lets you to incorporate and store your code and its dependencies into a handy package called an image. This image can then be used to spawn an instance of your application - a container. The main [difference between containers and Virtual Machines](/display/containers/Containers+vs+Virtual+Machines) is that containers only cover the application layer and rely on the underlying operating system kernel, whereas Virtual Machines run on a hypervisor, which creates a new instance of an operating system.
