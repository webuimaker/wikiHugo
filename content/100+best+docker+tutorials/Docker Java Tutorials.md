 - title: "Hands Off My Docker Containers: Dynamic Java Instrumentation in Three Easy Steps"
   summary: "Many AppDynamics customers have challenges with modifying startup scripts or updating images in order to inject Java agents, especially in a containerized environment. Other customers might not want to change their build process or completely restructure their projects just to try out a monitoring solution. Fortunately, there are ways to instrument Java applications without having to access startup scripts or docker-compose.yml files. This blog will show a solution that bundles the dynamic-attach functionality with infrastructure monitoring to instrument Java processes in a Docker environment."
