 - title: "How to Create a Private Docker Registry on Ubuntu 16.04"
   summary: "The official Docker registry has a large collection of images available for your use as a base for your own. Contributing to the repository is nearly as simple as pulling from it, but what do you do when you have images that should be kept private? You create a private registry hosted locally."

 - title: "Using Docker Push to Publish Images to Docker Hub"
   summary: "The ability to share container images on Docker Hub (Docker’s public/private registry) is what allows users to quickly share and build upon preexisting images. In this tutorial, we are going to use this feature while learning the docker push command and using it to upload Docker container image to Docker Hub."
