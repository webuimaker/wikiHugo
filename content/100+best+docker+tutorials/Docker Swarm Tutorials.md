 - title: "Consume Services in a Swarm Cluster"
   summary: " When we deploy microservices as containers across a compute cluster such as a Docker Swarm cluster, it's critical that we have a means of service discovery to call upon. It's central to our ability to consume services effectively. This tutorial explores the topic of service consumption, both from within and externally to a Swarm cluster."

 - title: "A Developer's Guide To Docker Swarm"
   summary: "Redundancy is a big deal when scaling websites. However, deploying and managing clusters of containers can quickly become untenable. While there are a few container orchestration tools out there like Kubernetes and Mesosphere (DC/OS), Docker has its own called Docker Swarm Mode. Swarm Mode allows you to deploy, scale, and manage clusters of Docker containers from a single command window. This tutorial, will show how to create a swarm, create some virtual machines that will be part of the swarm, deploy containers to the swarm, and scale those containers horizontally."

 - title: "How to Install and Configure Docker Swarm on Ubuntu"
   summary: "Docker Swarm is a clustering tool that turns a group of Docker hosts into a single virtual server. Docker Swarm ensures availability and high performance for your application by distributing it over the number of Docker hosts inside a cluster. Docker Swarm also allows you to increase the number of container instance for the same application. This tutorial will go through how to install and configure Docker Swarm mode on an Ubuntu 16.04 server"
