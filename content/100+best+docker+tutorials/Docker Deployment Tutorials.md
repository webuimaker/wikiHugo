 - title: "How to Deploy Microservices with Docker"
   summary: "Microservices are an increasingly popular architecture for building large-scale applications. Rather than using a single, monolithic codebase, applications are broken down into a collection of smaller components called microservices. This guide describes how to effectively use Docker in production using a sample NGINX/Flask/Gunicorn/Redis/Postgresql application stack"

This guide will demonstrate how to configure a highly scalable GitLab infrastructure that manages its own costs, and automatically responds to load by increasing and decreasing available server capacity."
