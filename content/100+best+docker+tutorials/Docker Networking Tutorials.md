 - title: "Docker Basic Networking"
   summary: "In the current application landscape, we see a strong rise of distributed applications. This is done by implementing a microservice architecture and deploying these applications in Docker containers. It’s important that these containers are able to communicate with each other, after all, what good is a microservice that is isolated? This tutorial will show you how to create networks within Docker and what they are used for and guide you through a step-by-step example on how to create a Docker network and add containers to it."

 - title: "Docker Networking Explained"
   summary: "One of the reasons Docker containers and services are so powerful is that you can connect them together, or connect them to non-Docker workloads. Get a basic understanding of Linux networking fundamentals and how they are carefully abstracted to create the Container Networking Model that drives Docker under the hood."

 - title: "The Docker Ecosystem: Networking and Communication"
   summary: "hen constructing distributed systems to serve Docker containers, communication and networking become extremely important. Service-oriented architecture, undeniably, relies heavily upon communication between components in order to function correctly.This guide, will discuss the various networking strategies and tools used to mold the networks used by containers into their desired state.
