 - title: "How to Create a Docker Image"
   summary: "In this article you will get a basic understanding of creating Docker images. There are prebuilt images available on DockerHub that you can use for your own project, and you can publish your own image there. You are going to use prebuilt images to get the base Linux subsystem, as it’s a lot of work to build one from scratch."

 - title: "How to create Docker Images with a Dockerfile"
   summary: " Docker makes it easier to create and deploy applications in an isolated environment. A Dockerfile is a script that contains collections of commands and instructions that will be automatically executed in sequence in the docker environment for building a new docker image. This tutorial will show you how to create your own docker image with a dockerfile and explain the dockerfile script in detail to enable you to build your own dockerfile scripts."
