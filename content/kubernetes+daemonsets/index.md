description: "Aggregating service logs, collecting node metrics, or running a networked storage cluster all require a container to be replicated across all nodes. In Kubernetes, this is done with a DaemonSet. A DaemonSet ensures that an instance of a specific pod is running on all (or a selection of) nodes in a cluster. This page gathers resources on how to use and deploying a daemon to all nodes."
