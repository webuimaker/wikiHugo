Kubernetes has exploded in growth over the past few years because of its powerful abilities to manage containers in production. While itâ€™s easy to spin up your first container locally, taking containers into production in a cloud environment is a completely different ball game. There are numerous aspects like scale, networking, security, high availability, and performance that need to be considered. All of these factors come into play when deploying containers. This makes deployment the most stressful part of running containers in production. Fortunately, Kubernetes is a mature and robust option for running containers in production and has some strong defaults, wide-ranging options, and is a complete package when looking for a tool to deploy containerized applications.
