Kubernetes is built to manage containers in production, and this is evident in the powerful features it has for deployments. It makes deployments easy by allowing you to control then using a simple YAML configuration file. It can do vanilla deployments where old versions are deleted and replaced by new ones, or it can take more mature approaches like rolling updates, blue-green deployments, and canary releases. You can experiment and find out which best suits your application. By understanding the various Kubernetes components involved in a deployment, and the many options at your disposal, you are now ready to take your Kubernetes deployments to the next level.
