description: "eBPF – extended Berkeley Packet Filter – is a Linux-native in-kernel virtual machine that enables secure, low-overhead tracing for application performance and event observability and analysis. eBPF delivers a lot more than network packet information, it can offer the deep visibility for cloud-native and container environments, from host and network data to container processes, resource utilization, and more.
