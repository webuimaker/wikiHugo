Kubernetes is known as a complex platform with a steep learning curve. Kubernetes Helm helps make Kubernetes easier and faster to use:

* <strong>Improves productivity - </strong>instead of spending time on deploying test environments to test their Kubernetes clusters, developers can deploy a pre-tested app via a Helm chart and focus on developing their applications.

* <strong>Existing Helm Charts - </strong>allow developers to get a working database, big data platform, CMS, etc. deployed for their application with one click. Developers can modify existing charts or create their own to automate dev, test or production processes.

* <strong>Easier to start with [Kubernetes](/display/containers/Kubernetes+101) - </strong>it can be difficult to get started with Kubernetes and learn how to deploy production-grade applications. Helm provides one click deployment of apps, making it much easier to get started and deploy your first app, even if you don't have extensive container experience.

* <strong>Reduced complexity - </strong>deployment of Kubernetes-orchestrated apps can be extremely complex. Using incorrect values in configuration files or failing to roll out apps correctly from YAML templates can break deployments. Helm Charts allow the community to preconfigure applications, defining values that are fixed and others that are configurable with sensible defaults, providing a consistent interface for changing configuration. This dramatically reduces complexity, and eliminates deployment errors by locking out incorrect configurations.
 
* <strong>Production ready - </strong>running Kubernetes in production with all its components (pods, namespaces, deployments, etc.) is difficult and prone to error. With a tested, stable Helm chart, users can deploy to production with confidence, and reduce the complexity of maintaining a Kubernetes App Catalog.

* <strong>No duplicated effort - </strong>once a developer has created a chart, tested and stabilized it once, it can be reused across multiple groups in an organization and outside it. Previously, it was much more difficult (but not impossible) to share Kubernetes applications and replicate them between environments.
